/*! \class QCPSelectionDecorator
  \brief Controls how a plottable's data selection is drawn
  
  Each \ref QCPAbstractPlottable instance has one \ref QCPSelectionDecorator (accessible via \ref
  QCPAbstractPlottable::selectionDecorator) and uses it when drawing selected segments of its data.
  
  The selection decorator controls both pen (\ref setPen) and brush (\ref setBrush), as well as the
  scatter style (\ref setScatterStyle) if the plottable draws scatters. Since a \ref
  QCPScatterStyle is itself composed of different properties such as color shape and size, the
  decorator allows specifying exactly which of those properties shall be used for the selected data
  point, via \ref setUsedScatterProperties.
  
  A \ref QCPSelectionDecorator subclass instance can be passed to a plottable via \ref
  QCPAbstractPlottable::setSelectionDecorator, allowing greater customizability of the appearance
  of selected segments.
  
  Use \ref copyFrom to easily transfer the settings of one decorator to another one. This is
  especially useful since plottables take ownership of the passed selection decorator, and thus the
  same decorator instance can not be passed to multiple plottables.
  
  Selection decorators can also themselves perform drawing operations by reimplementing \ref
  drawDecoration, which is called by the plottable's draw method. The base class \ref
  QCPSelectionDecorator does not make use of this however. For example, \ref
  QCPSelectionDecoratorBracket draws brackets around selected data segments.

/*! \class QCPAbstractPlottable
  \brief The abstract base class for all data representing objects in a plot.

  It defines a very basic interface like name, pen, brush, visibility etc. Since this class is
  abstract, it can't be instantiated. Use one of the subclasses or create a subclass yourself to
  create new ways of displaying data (see "Creating own plottables" below). Plottables that display
  one-dimensional data (i.e. data points have a single key dimension and one or multiple values at
  each key) are based off of the template subclass \ref QCPAbstractPlottable1D, see details
  there.
  
  All further specifics are in the subclasses, for example:
  \li A normal graph with possibly a line and/or scatter points \ref QCPGraph
  (typically created with \ref QCustomPlot::addGraph)
  \li A parametric curve: \ref QCPCurve
  \li A bar chart: \ref QCPBars
  \li A statistical box plot: \ref QCPStatisticalBox
  \li A color encoded two-dimensional map: \ref QCPColorMap
  \li An OHLC/Candlestick chart: \ref QCPFinancial
  
  \section plottables-subclassing Creating own plottables
  
  Subclassing directly from QCPAbstractPlottable is only recommended if you wish to display
  two-dimensional data like \ref QCPColorMap, i.e. two logical key dimensions and one (or more)
  data dimensions. If you want to display data with only one logical key dimension, you should
  rather derive from \ref QCPAbstractPlottable1D.
  
  If subclassing QCPAbstractPlottable directly, these are the pure virtual functions you must
  implement:
  \li \ref selectTest
  \li \ref draw
  \li \ref drawLegendIcon
  \li \ref getKeyRange
  \li \ref getValueRange
  
  See the documentation of those functions for what they need to do.
  
  For drawing your plot, you can use the \ref coordsToPixels functions to translate a point in plot
  coordinates to pixel coordinates. This function is quite convenient, because it takes the
  orientation of the key and value axes into account for you (x and y are swapped when the key axis
  is vertical and the value axis horizontal). If you are worried about performance (i.e. you need
  to translate many points in a loop like QCPGraph), you can directly use \ref
  QCPAxis::coordToPixel. However, you must then take care about the orientation of the axis
  yourself.
  
  Here are some important members you inherit from QCPAbstractPlottable:
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>QCustomPlot *\b mParentPlot</td>
    <td>A pointer to the parent QCustomPlot instance. The parent plot is inferred from the axes that are passed in the constructor.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QString \b mName</td>
    <td>The name of the plottable.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QPen \b mPen</td>
    <td>The generic pen of the plottable. You should use this pen for the most prominent data representing lines in the plottable
        (e.g QCPGraph uses this pen for its graph lines and scatters)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QBrush \b mBrush</td>
    <td>The generic brush of the plottable. You should use this brush for the most prominent fillable structures in the plottable
        (e.g. QCPGraph uses this brush to control filling under the graph)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>QPointer<\ref QCPAxis> \b mKeyAxis, \b mValueAxis</td>
    <td>The key and value axes this plottable is attached to. Call their QCPAxis::coordToPixel functions to translate coordinates
        to pixels in either the key or value dimension. Make sure to check whether the pointer is null before using it. If one of
        the axes is null, don't draw the plottable.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>\ref QCPSelectionDecorator \b mSelectionDecorator</td>
    <td>The currently set selection decorator which specifies how selected data of the plottable shall be drawn and decorated.
        When drawing your data, you must consult this decorator for the appropriate pen/brush before drawing unselected/selected data segments.
        Finally, you should call its \ref QCPSelectionDecorator::drawDecoration method at the end of your \ref draw implementation.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>\ref QCP::SelectionType \b mSelectable</td>
    <td>In which composition, if at all, this plottable's data may be selected. Enforcing this setting on the data selection is done
        by QCPAbstractPlottable automatically.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>\ref QCPDataSelection \b mSelection</td>
    <td>Holds the current selection state of the plottable's data, i.e. the selected data ranges (\ref QCPDataRange).</td>
  </tr>
