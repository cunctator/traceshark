/*! \class QCPSelectionRect
  \brief Provides rect/rubber-band data selection and range zoom interaction
  
  QCPSelectionRect is used by QCustomPlot when the \ref QCustomPlot::setSelectionRectMode is not
  \ref QCP::srmNone. When the user drags the mouse across the plot, the current selection rect
  instance (\ref QCustomPlot::setSelectionRect) is forwarded these events and makes sure an
  according rect shape is drawn. At the begin, during, and after completion of the interaction, it
  emits the corresponding signals \ref started, \ref changed, \ref canceled, and \ref accepted.
  
  The QCustomPlot instance connects own slots to the current selection rect instance, in order to
  react to an accepted selection rect interaction accordingly.
  
  \ref isActive can be used to check whether the selection rect is currently active. An ongoing
  selection interaction can be cancelled programmatically via calling \ref cancel at any time.
  
  The appearance of the selection rect can be controlled via \ref setPen and \ref setBrush.

  If you wish to provide custom behaviour, e.g. a different visual representation of the selection
  rect (\ref QCPSelectionRect::draw), you can subclass QCPSelectionRect and pass an instance of
  your subclass to \ref QCustomPlot::setSelectionRect.

  The user may cancel the selection interaction by pressing the escape key. In this case, \a event
  holds the respective input event.
