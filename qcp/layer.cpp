/*! \class QCPLayer
  \brief A layer that may contain objects, to control the rendering order

  The Layering system of QCustomPlot is the mechanism to control the rendering order of the
  elements inside the plot.

  It is based on the two classes QCPLayer and QCPLayerable. QCustomPlot holds an ordered list of
  one or more instances of QCPLayer (see QCustomPlot::addLayer, QCustomPlot::layer,
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer, etc.). When replotting, QCustomPlot goes through the list of layers
  bottom to top and successively draws the layerables of the layers into the paint buffer(s).

  A QCPLayer contains an ordered list of QCPLayerable instances. QCPLayerable is an abstract base
  class from which almost all visible objects derive, like axes, grids, graphs, items, etc.

  \section qcplayer-defaultlayers Default layers

  Initially, QCustomPlot has six layers: "background", "grid", "main", "axes", "legend" and
  "overlay" (in that order). On top is the "overlay" layer, which only contains the QCustomPlot's
  selection rect (\ref QCustomPlot::selectionRect). The next two layers "axes" and "legend" contain
  the default axes and legend, so they will be drawn above plottables. In the middle, there is the
  "main" layer. It is initially empty and set as the current layer (see
  QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer). This means, all new plottables, items etc. are created on this
  layer by default. Then comes the "grid" layer which contains the QCPGrid instances (which belong
  tightly to QCPAxis, see \ref QCPAxis::grid). The Axis rect background shall be drawn behind
  everything else, thus the default QCPAxisRect instance is placed on the "background" layer. Of
  course, the layer affiliation of the individual objects can be changed as required (\ref
  QCPLayerable::setLayer).

  \section qcplayer-ordering Controlling the rendering order via layers

  Controlling the ordering of layerables in the plot is easy: Create a new layer in the position
  you want the layerable to be in, e.g. above "main", with \ref QCustomPlot::addLayer. Then set the
  current layer with \ref QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer to that new layer and finally create the
  objects normally. They will be placed on the new layer automatically, due to the current layer
  setting. Alternatively you could have also ignored the current layer setting and just moved the
  objects with \ref QCPLayerable::setLayer to the desired layer after creating them.

  It is also possible to move whole layers. For example, If you want the grid to be shown in front
  of all plottables/items on the "main" layer, just move it above "main" with
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer.

  The rendering order within one layer is simply by order of creation or insertion. The item
  created last (or added last to the layer), is drawn on top of all other objects on that layer.

  When a layer is deleted, the objects on it are not deleted with it, but fall on the layer below
  the deleted layer, see QCustomPlot::removeLayer.

  \section qcplayer-buffering Replotting only a specific layer

  If the layer mode (\ref setMode) is set to \ref lmBuffered, you can replot only this specific
  layer by calling \ref replot. In certain situations this can provide better replot performance,
  compared with a full replot of all layers. Upon creation of a new layer, the layer mode is
  initialized to \ref lmLogical. The only layer that is set to \ref lmBuffered in a new \ref
  QCustomPlot instance is the "overlay" layer, containing the selection rect.
*/

/*! \fn QList<QCPLayerable*> QCPLayer::children() const
  
  Returns a list of all layerables on this layer. The order corresponds to the rendering order:
  layerables with higher indices are drawn above layerables with lower indices.
*/

  Layers which are set to \ref lmLogical (the default) are used only to define the rendering order
  and can't be replotted individually.

  Note that each layer which is set to \ref lmBuffered requires additional paint buffers for the
  layers below, above and for the layer itself. This increases the memory consumption and
  (slightly) decreases the repainting speed because multiple paint buffers need to be joined. So
  you should carefully choose which layers benefit from having their own paint buffer. A typical
  example would be a layer which contains certain layerables (e.g. items) that need to be changed
  and thus replotted regularly, while all other layerables on other layers stay static. By default,
  only the topmost layer called "overlay" is in mode \ref lmBuffered, and contains the selection

  This function applies the default antialiasing setting to the specified \a painter, using the
  function \ref applyAntialiasingHint. It is the antialiasing state the painter is put in, when
  \ref draw is called on the layerable. If the layerable has multiple entities whose antialiasing
  setting may be specified individually, this function should set the antialiasing state of the
  most prominent entity. In this case however, the \ref draw function usually calls the specialized
  versions of this function before drawing each entity, effectively overriding the setting of the
  default antialiasing hint.
  
  <b>First example:</b> QCPGraph has multiple entities that have an antialiasing setting: The graph
  line, fills and scatters. Those can be configured via QCPGraph::setAntialiased,
  QCPGraph::setAntialiasedFill and QCPGraph::setAntialiasedScatters. Consequently, there isn't only
  the QCPGraph::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint function (which corresponds to the graph line's
  antialiasing), but specialized ones like QCPGraph::applyFillAntialiasingHint and
  QCPGraph::applyScattersAntialiasingHint. So before drawing one of those entities, QCPGraph::draw
  calls the respective specialized applyAntialiasingHint function.
  
  <b>Second example:</b> QCPItemLine consists only of a line so there is only one antialiasing
  setting which can be controlled with QCPItemLine::setAntialiased. (This function is inherited by
  all layerables. The specialized functions, as seen on QCPGraph, must be added explicitly to the
  respective layerable subclass.) Consequently it only has the normal
  QCPItemLine::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint. The \ref QCPItemLine::draw function doesn't need to
  care about setting any antialiasing states, because the default antialiasing hint is already set
  on the painter when the \ref draw function is called, and that's the state it wants to draw the
  line with.

  This function is used to decide whether a click hits a layerable object or not.

  \a pos is a point in pixel coordinates on the QCustomPlot surface. This function returns the
  shortest pixel distance of this point to the object. If the object is either invisible or the
  distance couldn't be determined, -1.0 is returned. Further, if \a onlySelectable is true and the
  object is not selectable, -1.0 is returned, too.

  If the object is represented not by single lines but by an area like a \ref QCPItemText or the
  bars of a \ref QCPBars plottable, a click inside the area should also be considered a hit. In
  these cases this function thus returns a constant value greater zero but still below the parent
  plot's selection tolerance. (typically the selectionTolerance multiplied by 0.99).
  
  Providing a constant value for area objects allows selecting line objects even when they are
  obscured by such area objects, by clicking close to the lines (i.e. closer than
  0.99*selectionTolerance).
  
  The actual setting of the selection state is not done by this function. This is handled by the
  parent QCustomPlot when the mouseReleaseEvent occurs, and the finally selected object is notified
  via the \ref selectEvent/\ref deselectEvent methods.
  
  \a details is an optional output parameter. Every layerable subclass may place any information
  in \a details. This information will be passed to \ref selectEvent when the parent QCustomPlot
  decides on the basis of this selectTest call, that the object was successfully selected. The
  subsequent call to \ref selectEvent will carry the \a details. This is useful for multi-part
  objects (like QCPAxis). This way, a possibly complex calculation to decide which part was clicked
  is only done once in \ref selectTest. The result (i.e. the actually clicked part) can then be
  placed in \a details. So in the subsequent \ref selectEvent, the decision which part was
  selected doesn't have to be done a second time for a single selection operation.
  
  You may pass 0 as \a details to indicate that you are not interested in those selection details.

  This event is called when the layerable shall be selected, as a consequence of a click by the
  user. Subclasses should react to it by setting their selection state appropriately. The default
  implementation does nothing.
  
  \a event is the mouse event that caused the selection. \a additive indicates, whether the user
  was holding the multi-select-modifier while performing the selection (see \ref
  QCustomPlot::setMultiSelectModifier). if \a additive is true, the selection state must be toggled
  (i.e. become selected when unselected and unselected when selected).
  
  Every selectEvent is preceded by a call to \ref selectTest, which has returned positively (i.e.
  returned a value greater than 0 and less than the selection tolerance of the parent QCustomPlot).
  The \a details data you output from \ref selectTest is fed back via \a details here. You may
  use it to transport any kind of information from the selectTest to the possibly subsequent
  selectEvent. Usually \a details is used to transfer which part was clicked, if it is a layerable
  that has multiple individually selectable parts (like QCPAxis). This way selectEvent doesn't need
  to do the calculation again to find out which part was actually clicked.
  
  \a selectionStateChanged is an output parameter. If the pointer is non-null, this function must
  set the value either to true or false, depending on whether the selection state of this layerable
  was actually changed. For layerables that only are selectable as a whole and not in parts, this
  is simple: if \a additive is true, \a selectionStateChanged must also be set to true, because the
  selection toggles. If \a additive is false, \a selectionStateChanged is only set to true, if the
  layerable was previously unselected and now is switched to the selected state.

  This event gets called when the user presses a mouse button while the cursor is over the
  layerable. Whether a cursor is over the layerable is decided by a preceding call to \ref
  selectTest.

  The current pixel position of the cursor on the QCustomPlot widget is accessible via \c
  event->pos(). The parameter \a details contains layerable-specific details about the hit, which
  were generated in the previous call to \ref selectTest. For example, One-dimensional plottables
  like \ref QCPGraph or \ref QCPBars convey the clicked data point in the \a details parameter, as
  \ref QCPDataSelection packed as QVariant. Multi-part objects convey the specific \c
  SelectablePart that was hit (e.g. \ref QCPAxis::SelectablePart in the case of axes).

  QCustomPlot uses an event propagation system that works the same as Qt's system. If your
  layerable doesn't reimplement the \ref mousePressEvent or explicitly calls \c event->ignore() in
  its reimplementation, the event will be propagated to the next layerable in the stacking order.

  Once a layerable has accepted the \ref mousePressEvent, it is considered the mouse grabber and
