  \brief The central class of the library. This is the QWidget which displays the plot and
  interacts with the user.
  
  For tutorials on how to use QCustomPlot, see the website\n

/*! \fn QCPSelectionRect *QCustomPlot::selectionRect() const
  
  Allows access to the currently used QCPSelectionRect instance (or subclass thereof), that is used
  to handle and draw selection rect interactions (see \ref setSelectionRectMode).
  
  \see setSelectionRect
*/

/*! \fn QCPLayoutGrid *QCustomPlot::plotLayout() const
  
  Returns the top level layout of this QCustomPlot instance. It is a \ref QCPLayoutGrid, initially containing just

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mouseDoubleClick(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse double click event.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mousePress(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse press event.
  
  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanism like range dragging. So a slot
  connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDrag or \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes.

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse move event.
  
  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanism like range dragging. So a slot
  connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDrag or \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes.
  
  \warning It is discouraged to change the drag-axes with \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes here,
  because the dragging starting point was saved the moment the mouse was pressed. Thus it only has
  a meaning for the range drag axes that were set at that moment. If you want to change the drag
  axes, consider doing this in the \ref mousePress signal instead.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mouseRelease(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse release event.
  
  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanisms like object selection. So a
  slot connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref setInteractions or
  \ref QCPAbstractPlottable::setSelectable.

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::mouseWheel(QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when the QCustomPlot receives a mouse wheel event.
  
  It is emitted before QCustomPlot handles any other mechanisms like range zooming. So a slot
  connected to this signal can still influence the behaviour e.g. with \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoom, \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoomAxes or \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoomFactor.
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::plottableClick(QCPAbstractPlottable *plottable, int dataIndex, QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when a plottable is clicked.

  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click and \a plottable is the plottable that received
  the click. The parameter \a dataIndex indicates the data point that was closest to the click
  position.

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::legendClick(QCPLegend *legend, QCPAbstractLegendItem *item, QMouseEvent *event)

  This signal is emitted when a legend (item) is clicked.
  
  \a event is the mouse event that caused the click, \a legend is the legend that received the
  click and \a item is the legend item that received the click. If only the legend and no item is
  clicked, \a item is 0. This happens for a click inside the legend padding or the space between
  two items.
  
  \see legendDoubleClick

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::selectionChangedByUser()
  
  This signal is emitted after the user has changed the selection in the QCustomPlot, e.g. by
  clicking. It is not emitted when the selection state of an object has changed programmatically by
  a direct call to <tt>setSelected()</tt>/<tt>setSelection()</tt> on an object or by calling \ref
  deselectAll.
  
  In addition to this signal, selectable objects also provide individual signals, for example \ref
  QCPAxis::selectionChanged or \ref QCPAbstractPlottable::selectionChanged. Note that those signals
  are emitted even if the selection state is changed programmatically.
  
  See the documentation of \ref setInteractions for details about the selection mechanism.
  
  \see selectedPlottables, selectedGraphs, selectedItems, selectedAxes, selectedLegends
*/

/*! \fn void QCustomPlot::beforeReplot()
  
  This signal is emitted immediately before a replot takes place (caused by a call to the slot \ref
  replot).
  
  It is safe to mutually connect the replot slot with this signal on two QCustomPlots to make them
  replot synchronously, it won't cause an infinite recursion.

  A pointer to the primary x Axis (bottom) of the main axis rect of the plot.
  
  QCustomPlot offers convenient pointers to the axes (\ref xAxis, \ref yAxis, \ref xAxis2, \ref

  axis rect), the corresponding pointers become 0.
  
  If an axis convenience pointer is currently zero and a new axis rect or a corresponding axis is

  Sets the possible interactions of this QCustomPlot as an or-combination of \ref QCP::Interaction
  enums. There are the following types of interactions:
  
  <b>Axis range manipulation</b> is controlled via \ref QCP::iRangeDrag and \ref QCP::iRangeZoom. When the
  respective interaction is enabled, the user may drag axes ranges and zoom with the mouse wheel.
  For details how to control which axes the user may drag/zoom and in what orientations, see \ref
  QCPAxisRect::setRangeDrag, \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoom, \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeDragAxes,
  \ref QCPAxisRect::setRangeZoomAxes.
  
  <b>Plottable data selection</b> is controlled by \ref QCP::iSelectPlottables. If \ref
  QCP::iSelectPlottables is set, the user may select plottables (graphs, curves, bars,...) and
  their data by clicking on them or in their vicinity (\ref setSelectionTolerance). Whether the
  user can actually select a plottable and its data can further be restricted with the \ref
  QCPAbstractPlottable::setSelectable method on the specific plottable. For details, see the
  special page about the \ref dataselection "data selection mechanism". To retrieve a list of all
  currently selected plottables, call \ref selectedPlottables. If you're only interested in
  QCPGraphs, you may use the convenience function \ref selectedGraphs.
  
  <b>Item selection</b> is controlled by \ref QCP::iSelectItems. If \ref QCP::iSelectItems is set, the user
  may select items (QCPItemLine, QCPItemText,...) by clicking on them or in their vicinity. To find
  out whether a specific item is selected, call QCPAbstractItem::selected(). To retrieve a list of
  all currently selected items, call \ref selectedItems.
  
  <b>Axis selection</b> is controlled with \ref QCP::iSelectAxes. If \ref QCP::iSelectAxes is set, the user
  may select parts of the axes by clicking on them. What parts exactly (e.g. Axis base line, tick
  labels, axis label) are selectable can be controlled via \ref QCPAxis::setSelectableParts for
  each axis. To retrieve a list of all axes that currently contain selected parts, call \ref

  <b>Legend selection</b> is controlled with \ref QCP::iSelectLegend. If this is set, the user may

  find out which child items are selected, call \ref QCPLegend::selectedItems.

  QCPTextElement, or your own layerable subclasses) is controlled with \ref QCP::iSelectOther. If set, the
  user may select those objects by clicking on them. To find out which are currently selected, you
  need to check their selected state explicitly.
  
  If the selection state has changed by user interaction, the \ref selectionChangedByUser signal is
  emitted. Each selectable object additionally emits an individual selectionChanged signal whenever
  their selection state has changed, i.e. not only by user interaction.
  
  To allow multiple objects to be selected by holding the selection modifier (\ref
  setMultiSelectModifier), set the flag \ref QCP::iMultiSelect.

  This method allows to enable OpenGL plot rendering, for increased plotting performance of
  graphically demanding plots (thick lines, translucent fills, etc.).

  If \a enabled is set to true, QCustomPlot will try to initialize OpenGL and, if successful,
  continue plotting with hardware acceleration. The parameter \a multisampling controls how many
  samples will be used per pixel, it essentially controls the antialiasing quality. If \a
  multisampling is set too high for the current graphics hardware, the maximum allowed value will
  be used.

  You can test whether switching to OpenGL rendering was successful by checking whether the
  according getter \a QCustomPlot::openGl() returns true. If the OpenGL initialization fails,
  rendering continues with the regular software rasterizer, and an according qDebug output is
  generated.

  If switching to OpenGL was successful, this method disables label caching (\ref setPlottingHint
  "setPlottingHint(QCP::phCacheLabels, false)") and turns on QCustomPlot's antialiasing override
  for all elements (\ref setAntialiasedElements "setAntialiasedElements(QCP::aeAll)"), leading to a
  higher quality output. The antialiasing override allows for pixel-grid aligned drawing in the
  OpenGL paint device. As stated before, in OpenGL rendering the actual antialiasing of the plot is
  controlled with \a multisampling. If \a enabled is set to false, the antialiasing/label caching
  settings are restored to what they were before OpenGL was enabled, if they weren't altered in the
  meantime.

  \note OpenGL support is only enabled if QCustomPlot is compiled with the macro \c QCUSTOMPLOT_USE_OPENGL
  defined. This define must be set before including the QCustomPlot header both during compilation
  of the QCustomPlot library as well as when compiling your application. It is best to just include
  the line <tt>DEFINES += QCUSTOMPLOT_USE_OPENGL</tt> in the respective qmake project files.
  \note If you are using a Qt version before 5.0, you must also add the module "opengl" to your \c
  QT variable in the qmake project files. For Qt versions 5.0 and higher, QCustomPlot switches to a
  newer OpenGL interface which is already in the "gui" module.

  Causes a complete replot into the internal paint buffer(s). Finally, the widget surface is
  refreshed with the new buffer contents. This is the method that must be called to make changes to
  the plot, e.g. on the axis ranges or data points of graphs, visible.

  The parameter \a refreshPriority can be used to fine-tune the timing of the replot. For example
  if your application calls \ref replot very quickly in succession (e.g. multiple independent
  functions change some aspects of the plot and each wants to make sure the change gets replotted),
  it is advisable to set \a refreshPriority to \ref QCustomPlot::rpQueuedReplot. This way, the
  actual replotting is deferred to the next event loop iteration. Multiple successive calls of \ref
  replot with this priority will only cause a single replot, avoiding redundant replots and
  improving performance.

  Under a few circumstances, QCustomPlot causes a replot by itself. Those are resize events of the
  QCustomPlot widget and user interactions (object selection and range dragging/zooming).

  Before the replot happens, the signal \ref beforeReplot is emitted. After the replot, \ref
  afterReplot is emitted. It is safe to mutually connect the replot slot with any of those two
  signals on two QCustomPlots to make them replot synchronously, it won't cause an infinite
  recursion.

  If a layer is in mode \ref QCPLayer::lmBuffered (\ref QCPLayer::setMode), it is also possible to
  replot only that specific layer via \ref QCPLayer::replot. See the documentation there for
  details.

  Saves a PDF with the vectorized plot to the file \a fileName. The axis ratio as well as the scale
  of texts and lines will be derived from the specified \a width and \a height. This means, the
  output will look like the normal on-screen output of a QCustomPlot widget with the corresponding
  pixel width and height. If either \a width or \a height is zero, the exported image will have the
  same dimensions as the QCustomPlot widget currently has.

  Setting \a exportPen to \ref QCP::epNoCosmetic allows to disable the use of cosmetic pens when
  drawing to the PDF file. Cosmetic pens are pens with numerical width 0, which are always drawn as
  a one pixel wide line, no matter what zoom factor is set in the PDF-Viewer. For more information
  about cosmetic pens, see the QPainter and QPen documentation.

  The objects of the plot will appear in the current selection state. If you don't want any
  selected objects to be painted in their selected look, deselect everything with \ref deselectAll
  before calling this function.

  Returns true on success.

  \warning
  \li If you plan on editing the exported PDF file with a vector graphics editor like Inkscape, it
  is advised to set \a exportPen to \ref QCP::epNoCosmetic to avoid losing those cosmetic lines
  (which might be quite many, because cosmetic pens are the default for e.g. axes and tick marks).
  \li If calling this function inside the constructor of the parent of the QCustomPlot widget
  (i.e. the MainWindow constructor, if QCustomPlot is inside the MainWindow), always provide
  explicit non-zero widths and heights. If you leave \a width or \a height as 0 (default), this
  function uses the current width and height of the QCustomPlot widget. However, in Qt, these
  aren't defined yet inside the constructor, so you would get an image that has strange
  widths/heights.

  \a pdfCreator and \a pdfTitle may be used to set the according metadata fields in the resulting
  PDF file.

  \note On Android systems, this method does nothing and issues an according qDebug warning
  message. This is also the case if for other reasons the define flag \c QT_NO_PRINTER is set.

/*!
  Saves a PNG image file to \a fileName on disc. The output plot will have the dimensions \a width
  and \a height in pixels, multiplied by \a scale. If either \a width or \a height is zero, the
  current width and height of the QCustomPlot widget is used instead. Line widths and texts etc.
  are not scaled up when larger widths/heights are used. If you want that effect, use the \a scale
  parameter.

  For example, if you set both \a width and \a height to 100 and \a scale to 2, you will end up with an
  image file of size 200*200 in which all graphical elements are scaled up by factor 2 (line widths,
  texts, etc.). This scaling is not done by stretching a 100*100 image, the result will have full
  200*200 pixel resolution.

  If you use a high scaling factor, it is recommended to enable antialiasing for all elements by
  temporarily setting \ref QCustomPlot::setAntialiasedElements to \ref QCP::aeAll as this allows
  QCustomPlot to place objects with sub-pixel accuracy.

  image compression can be controlled with the \a quality parameter which must be between 0 and 100
